Actually, sometimes I say I'm a Software Engineer, sometimes I say I'm a UX & Interaction Design Engineer because it's cool, 
and sometimes I say I'm Fabiana who loves art, pizza and technology. Best trio. 
I'm an enthusiast for Computational interaction topics, UI/UX, Machine Learning, User Research, Information Visualization and Data analysis. 
I was born near the Amalfitan coast, Italy. 
It is obvious that I love the sea, good wine and bright sunsets. 
In life I sometimes "lag" even though mum says I am her favourite daughter. 
Please don't tell my brothers.
